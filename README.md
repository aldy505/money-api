# Money API

This was supposed to be a Paypal API clone. But somehow it turns into a monster of a payment app.

Don't know why.

A work in progress.

## Features

- Regular auth: Login, Signup, Verify. No Logout because I don't store whether the user is logged in or not on the database.
- Friends: Like contacts, but all you can see is just your tag and your transactions with them. You can also add and remove them, of course.
- Send money (of course).
- Request money, alongside with cancel or reject the requested money.

## Can I use it for learning purposes?

Sure. The easiest way around is to pull the Docker image from the Package section on the right (slight below Releases).
